# Reporting Security Issues

The what3words team actively releases security fixes and we appreciate any support from our community towards this effort.

Please do not report security vulnerabilities on the public GitHub issue tracker. Our [Vulnerability Report Form](https://share.hsforms.com/1CvZaB2rIRxGqTWUg93ziaA1p3ix)Â details the procedure for disclosing security issues.

Please report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".
