## Getting Started

- Working with [packages](./packages/):

  - [what3words components](./packages/components/README.md): contains our published component libraries.
  - [shared modules](./packages/shared/README.md): contains private modules that are shared between different projects/workspaces. They are not published to any registry and only serve to abstract common cross-functional logic/assets.

- Working with [apps](./apps/):

  - [examples](./apps/examples/README.md): contains applications that consume our libraries/modules using various web frameworks and their respective testing harnesses.
    - [component examples](./apps/examples/components/README.md): contains quickstarts that serve as a reference for end-users integrating the what3words components libraries into their own applications.
    - [components test harness](./apps/examples/e2e/README.md): contains e2e tests that are run against component example targets. These are run in our CI pipeline and ensure that our component is functional across a range of application contexts.
  - [demos](./apps/demos/README.md): contains applications that exhibit domain-specific use cases e.g. navigation, e-commerce checkouts. These serve as demonstrations for how what3words can be used in different industry contexts.
    - [components playground](./apps/demos/components-playground/README.md): serves as a components development environment for changes to be locally tested with a property configurator UI for enhanced DX.

## What is what3words?

what3words is the easy way to describe any precise location. It has divided the world into a grid of 3 metre squares and given each square a unique address made from 3 random words.

what3words can be used via the free mobile app and the online map at [what3words.com](http://what3words.com). Thereâ€™s also an [API](https://developer.what3words.com/public-api) that developers can use to integrate what3words into their own apps and platforms.

Here are some of the ways people around the world like to use what3words:

- telling friends exactly where to meet, especially in big or busy public places
- entering a precise destination into a vehicle or ride-hailing app
- telling couriers exactly where to drop off deliveries (such as a front door or side entrance)
- telling emergency services exactly where help is needed

Businesses in logistics and e-commerce, automotive, navigation, mobility and travel, as well as some emergency response teams, use what3words to operate more efficiently and provide a better service.
